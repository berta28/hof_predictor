# Welcome!
Welcome to the Baseball Hall of Fame Predictor app! This app allows users to explore a baseball dataset and build a logistic regression model to predict if a player will be inducted into the Hall of Fame based on their career statistics. Follow the steps below to use the app effectively.

## How to Use the App

### 1. Select Features and Filters:

* Navigate to the "Dataset" tab to select the features and filters for training the model.
* Choose features such as Total Years, Total Games, Total At Bats, and more to include in the model.
* Apply filters for the year, games played, at-bats, and batting average to refine the dataset.

### 2. Explore the Dataset:

* Go to the "Explore Dataset" tab to visualize the data.
* Select features to plot against each other and explore their distributions and relationships.
* Use density plots to see how features vary between players who were inducted into the Hall of Fame and those who were not.

### 3. Build the Model:

* In the "Model" tab, trains a logistic regression model with the selected features.
* View the model summary AUC and coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction.

### 4. Evaluate the Model:

* Visit the "Model Evaluation" tab to evaluate the model's performance.
* Plot features against predicted probabilities to see how well the model predicts Hall of Fame induction.

### 5. Make Predictions:

* Use the "Prediction" tab to enter the career statistics of a player and predict their likelihood of being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
* Enter player statistics such as total years played, total games, total at-bats, total runs, etc.
* The app will display the predicted probability and an image indicating whether the player is likely or unlikely to be inducted.
